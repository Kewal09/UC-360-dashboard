# Power BI Service Analytics Dashboard
An end-to-end Power BI dashboard built with synthetic datasets simulating real-world challenges. Cleaned, modeled, and visualized data to generate actionable insights on profitability, bookings, customer feedback, operations, and technician performance.

(I) Business Problem
Helping service-based businesses optimize operations, track technician performance, and improve customer satisfaction through actionable, data-driven insights.
Service-based companies often struggle to monitor booking patterns, customer feedback, operational efficiency, and service profitability due to fragmented or messy data. This dashboard provides a single interactive platform to identify trends, allocate resources efficiently, and make informed strategic decisions.


(II) Project Summary:-
This dashboard was developed as part of my capstone project, using seven synthetic datasets (1,000 records each) covering:
1. Customers
2. Bookings
3. Payments
4. Technicians
5. Attendance
6. Ratings
7. Service 

To make the project realistic, the datasets included duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats. I applied Power Query for cleaning and transforming the data, designed a relational data model, created DAX measures and KPIs such as Average Booking Time, Complaint Ratio, Rebooking Rate, Technician Utilization, and Profitability, and built a five-page interactive dashboard.
The dashboard provides actionable insights on business performance, including areas for improving customer rebooking rates, optimizing technician allocation, and prioritizing high-margin services.

(III) Features:-
1. Realistic Data Challenges: Introduced duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats to simulate real-world datasets.
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Used Power Query for deduplication, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
3. Relational Data Model: Linked customers, bookings, payments, technicians, attendance, ratings, and service categories for comprehensive analysis.
4. DAX Measures & KPIs: Key metrics include:

4.1. Average Booking Time
4.2. Complaint Ratio
4.3. Rebooking Rate
4.4. Technician Utilization
4.5. Profitability

(IV) Five-Page Interactive Dashboard insights on:-

1. Profitability Trends
2. Booking Patterns
3. Customer Feedback
4. Operational Insights
5. Technician Performance

(V) Datasets:-
The project uses synthetic datasets generated with ChatGPT (1,000 records each). They are structured to reflect real-world business scenarios for customers, bookings, payments, technicians, and service categories.

(VI) Learning Outcomes
1. Handling messy data and applying real-world data cleaning techniques
2. Designing relational data models in Power BI
3. Creating DAX measures and KPIs for actionable insights
4. Building interactive dashboards with multiple visuals for decision-making
5. Translating data insights into business recommendations
